# Rainbow Spinner üåàüåàüåàüåà
This project is a fun terminal-based "Rainbow Spinner" that cycles through colorful loading animations. It‚Äôs a simple yet visually engaging application that shows a spinning loader with text that changes its color every 500 milliseconds, simulating a "loading rainbows" effect.

# How It Works
Spinner Animation: The program uses the ora package to create a spinning animation.
Color Cycling: Colors are switched every 500ms using an array of predefined colors (red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan) from the chalk package.
Timed Exit: The spinner runs for 10 seconds, then stops and exits gracefully.
# Setup Instructions
1. Install Required Packages
To run the spinner, ensure you have Node.js installed. Then install the dependencies using the following command:

bash
Code kopieren
npm install
2. Install Nodemon
For a smoother development experience, install nodemon globally if you don‚Äôt already have it:

bash
Code kopieren
npm install -g nodemon
3. Run the Spinner
Run the script with the following command:

bash
Code kopieren
nodemon index.js
4. Observe the Magic ‚ú®
After running the script, you'll see the spinner animation in your terminal.
The text "Loading rainbows" will cycle through six colors (red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan) for 10 seconds before the spinner stops and the program exits.
Key Files
functions.js: Contains the getNextColor function, which cycles through the colors array and loops back to the start when all colors are used.
index.js: The main script responsible for the spinner logic and output.
package.json: Manages dependencies and defines the project as an ECMAScript module (type: "module").
Example Output
Here's an example of what the output looks like (colors will change dynamically):

Code kopieren
‚†è Loading rainbows
‚†ô Loading rainbows
‚†π Loading rainbows
‚†∏ Loading rainbows
‚†º Loading rainbows
Each "rainbows" text will appear in a different color every half-second, creating a vibrant and engaging terminal experience.

# Enjoy your colorful journey of loading rainbows! üåà
